# The Care Ranch — Brochure Project

## What this is
An evolving set of HTML brochure drafts for The Care Ranch, deployed via GitHub Pages. The client reviews and compares drafts through a `versions.html` index page that lists every version with a changelog. **v10 is the current layout redesign.**

Also contains the original v7 feedback and legacy .docx tooling from earlier rounds.

## Version workflow

Each iteration creates a **new file in `main`**, not a new branch:

1. Copy the previous version: `cp brochure-vN.html brochure-v(N+1).html`
2. Edit the new file.
3. Add a new `<a class="version">` block at the top of `versions.html` with a "What changed" bullet list.
4. Commit + push. GitHub Pages rebuilds in ~1 min.

Every version gets its own permanent URL. The client bookmarks `versions.html` once and can click into any version at any time. Old URLs never expire — critical for the "she might want to revisit v8 next week" use case.

Branches are optional; use them for experimental work, but sharing with the client always goes through the main-branch versioned file.

## Content rules

- **When layout changes, preserve text byte-for-byte** (e.g. v9 → v10 was pure layout, zero copy edits). The client's previous copy approvals carry forward.
- **Never filter, recolor, crop, or harmonize client photos.** Client's explicit rule. CSS `object-position` for display cropping is OK as a narrow exception when explicitly requested (used for `retreat-77` in v10).
- **Photos** are extracted via `pdfimages -all` from the PDFs in `client-input/Pictures/` (gitignored — the PDFs are ~155 MB combined).

## Deployment
- **Repo:** https://github.com/willem4130/care-ranch-brochure-feedback
- **Feedback page:** https://willem4130.github.io/care-ranch-brochure-feedback/
- **Versions index:** https://willem4130.github.io/care-ranch-brochure-feedback/versions.html
- **Current draft:** https://willem4130.github.io/care-ranch-brochure-feedback/brochure-v10.html
- Commit to main → GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically.

## .docx generation (legacy — v8 only)
The `scripts/generate_brochure_v8.py` script was used in the v8 round to produce a Word doc alongside the HTML. Not used for v9+. Kept for reference.

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_brochure_v8.py
```
Requires `python-docx`. Loads `client-input/brochure-v7-original.docx` as a template to inherit theme fonts (Calibri headings, Cambria body). Always `Document(TEMPLATE)`, never `Document()` (the latter creates Word's default blue-serif theme).

The original (Google Docs export) stores formatting as paragraph- and run-level overrides:
- **H1:** run-level 23pt bold, paragraph space_before=24pt
- **H2:** run-level 17pt bold, paragraph space_after=4pt
- **H3:** run-level 13pt bold, paragraph space_before=14pt
- **Body:** paragraph space_after=12pt
- **No bullet styles** — list items are plain 'normal' paragraphs

## Context
- Brochure was written in Dutch first, then translated/composed into English
- v8 incorporated all feedback from `feedback/brochure-v7-feedback.md`
- v8 → v9: content additions — international network/Wageningen, whole food nutrition as Method pillar, empathetic opener, outcome bullets, explicit expert language, target-groups note
- v9 → v10: pure layout redesign — full-bleed hero, 2-column splits, 2×3 method grid, 3-column team cards, 3-step journey timeline, 2-column benefit + info grids
- Reference project for brand/design: `/Users/willemvandenberg/Dev/The Care Ranch/thecareranch-landingpage`
- **Brand colors:** sand `#F7F4F0`, cream `#F2EDE4`, terracotta `#C47D5C`, saddle `#79584A`, charcoal `#3D3632`
- **Brand fonts:** Playfair Display (display), Lora (body) via Google Fonts

## Pending (as of v10)
- Individual team portraits — placeholder boxes with initials shown until real photos arrive
- Tara-removal AI edit on the team group photo (retreat-118)
- "Een foto en stukje" ambiguity — unclear whether client wants expert cards (photo + bio) or just a body-copy style reference
